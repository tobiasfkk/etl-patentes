		<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present subject matter relates generally to tillage implements that may be operated within an agricultural field.</p>
		<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
		<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In some cases, to increase agricultural performance from a field, a farmer may cultivate the soil, typically through a tillage operation. For instance, tillage operations may be performed by pulling a tillage implement behind an agricultural work vehicle, such as a tractor. Tillage implements can include one or more ground-engaging tools configured to engage the soil as the implement is moved across the field. For example, in certain configurations, the implement may include one or more harrow discs, leveling discs, rolling baskets, shanks, tines, and/or the like. Such ground-engaging tool(s) loosen and/or otherwise agitate the soil to prepare the field for subsequent planting operations.</p>
		<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During tillage operations, various amounts of residue may cause negative effects on the tillage operation. Accordingly, an improved system and method for mitigating any negative effects would be welcomed in the technology.</p>
		<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
		<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects and advantages of the technology will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the technology.</p>
		<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some aspects, the present subject matter is directed to an agricultural system that includes an implement including a frame assembly and one or more ground-engaging tools operably supported by the frame assembly. An implement actuator is operably coupled with the frame assembly and is configured to alter a position of one or more frame members of the frame assembly relative to a ground surface. A computing system is communicatively coupled to the implement actuator. The computing system includes a processor and associated memory. The memory stores instructions that, when implemented by the processor, configure the computing system to receive data indicative of residue size, determine an implement levelness based at least partially on the residue size, and determine an implement actuator model based at least partially on the implement levelness.</p>
		<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some aspects, the present subject matter is directed to a method for operating an agricultural system. The method includes receiving, from one or more field sensors, data indicative of residue size. The method also includes determining, with a computing system, an implement levelness based at least partially on the residue size. Lastly, the method includes determining, with a computing system, an implement actuator model based at least partially on the implement levelness.</p>

		<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
		<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the disclosure, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the discourse, not limitation of the disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit of the disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part can be used with another embodiment to yield still a further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
		<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this document, relational terms, such as first and second, top and bottom, and the like, are used solely to distinguish one entity or action from another entity or action, without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities or actions. The terms “comprises,” “comprising,” or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion, such that a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements does not include only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus. An element preceded by “comprises . . . a” does not, without more constraints, preclude the existence of additional identical elements in the process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises the element.</p>
		<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, the terms “first,” “second,” and “third” may be used interchangeably to distinguish one component from another and are not intended to signify a location or importance of the individual components. The terms “coupled,” “fixed,” “attached to,” and the like refer to both direct coupling, fixing, or attaching, as well as indirect coupling, fixing, or attaching through one or more intermediate components or features, unless otherwise specified herein. The terms “upstream” and “downstream” refer to the relative direction with respect to an agricultural product within a fluid circuit. For example, “upstream” refers to the direction from which an agricultural product flows, and “downstream” refers to the direction to which the agricultural product moves. The term “selectively” refers to a component's ability to operate in various states (e.g., an ON state and an OFF state) based at least partially on manual and/or automatic control of the component.</p>
		<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively “associated” such that the functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as “associated with” each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being “operably connected” or “operably coupled” to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being “operably couplable” to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Some examples of operably couplable include, but are not limited to, physically mateable, physically interacting components, wirelessly interactable, wirelessly interacting components, logically interacting, and/or logically interactable components.</p>
		<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
		<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Approximating language, as used herein throughout the specification and claims, is applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related. Accordingly, a value modified by a term or terms, such as “about,” “approximately,” “generally,” and “substantially,” is not to be limited to the precise value specified. In at least some instances, the approximating language may correspond to the precision of an instrument for measuring the value, or the precision of the methods or apparatus for constructing or manufacturing the components and/or systems. For example, the approximating language may refer to being within a ten percent margin.</p>
		<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Moreover, the technology of the present application will be described in relation to exemplary embodiments. The word “exemplary” is used herein to mean “serving as an example, instance, or illustration.” Any embodiment described herein as “exemplary” is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Additionally, unless specifically identified otherwise, all embodiments described herein should be considered exemplary.</p>
		<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the term “and/or,” when used in a list of two or more items, means that any one of the listed items can be employed by itself, or any combination of two or more of the listed items can be employed. For example, if a composition or assembly is described as containing components A, B, and/or C, the composition or assembly can contain A alone; B alone; C alone; A and B in combination; A and C in combination; B and C in combination; or A, B, and C in combination.</p>
		<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In general, the present subject matter is directed to agricultural systems and methods for operating the agricultural systems that may incorporate a tillage implement. In some cases, the agricultural system includes an implement including a frame assembly. One or more ground-engaging tools can be operably supported by the frame assembly. An implement actuator can be operably coupled with the frame assembly and configured to alter a position of one or more frame members of the frame assembly relative to a ground surface.</p>
		<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A computing system can be communicatively coupled to the implement actuator. The computing system can include a processor and associated memory. The memory stores instructions that, when implemented by the processor, can configure the computing system to receive data indicative of residue size, determine an implement levelness based at least partially on the residue size, and determine an implement actuator model based at least partially on the implement levelness. As used herein, the implement actuator model defines a position of the one or more implement actuators, in order for the frame assembly to be placed at the defined implement levelness.</p>
		<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In various examples, the implement levelness may be compared to a levelness range defined by a lower threshold and an upper threshold, which may be set to mitigate seedbed levelness issues and/or for any other purpose. In some instances, the system may compare the implement levelness to the levelness range to ensure that the defined implement levelness does not exceed the limits for seedbed floor levelness. In some cases, when the determined implement levelness is within the levelness range, the system can define an implement actuator model that correlates to the implement levelness and, in turn, actuate the one or more implement actuators to modify the position of one or more components of the frame assembly (e.g., an angle and position of the implement relative to the ground and/or the vehicle) based on the implement actuator model. When the determined implement levelness deviates from the levelness range, the implement actuator model is set to a maximum offset angle when the implement actuator model exceeds an upper threshold of the defined levelness range. Likewise, the system can set the implement actuator model to a minimum offset angle when the implement actuator model is less than a lower threshold of the defined levelness range. In addition, the system can continue to observe the potential for/of plugging of the implement based at least partially on the frame being placed in the implement actuator model.</p>

		<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of motor vehicles, where the main purpose is to transport “people” or “objects,” electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular. In these vehicles, the driving force (traction) is generated by an electric motor (hereinafter referred to as “motor”) instead of an internal combustion engine.</p>
		<p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, there is a need to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO
			<sub>2</sub>) emitted by work vehicles, such as tractors used in agricultural fields, to realize a decarbonized society. Unlike typical automobiles, work vehicles such as tractors need to tow implements, which are work machines, to perform agricultural tasks such as plowing. Therefore, to achieve the electrification of work vehicles, there are issues to be solved that differ from those of passenger cars.

		<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
		<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The following describes example embodiments of the present disclosure. However, excessively detailed explanations may be omitted. For example, detailed explanations of well-known matters and repetitive explanations of substantially identical configurations may be omitted. This is to avoid the following description from becoming unnecessarily redundant and to facilitate understanding by those skilled in the art. The inventors provide the attached drawings and the following description to enable those skilled in the art to fully understand this disclosure, and do not intend to limit the subject matter described in the claims by these drawing and description. In the following description, the same reference numerals are used for components with the same or similar functions.</p>
		<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The following example embodiments are illustrative and not limiting. The technologies disclosed herein are not restricted to the following example embodiments. For instance, the numerical values, shapes, materials, steps, the order of those steps, screen layouts, and other elements shown in the following example embodiments are merely examples. Various modifications can be made as long as no technical contradictions arise. Additionally, different features, elements, characteristics, etc., of the example embodiments may be combined as long as there are no technical contradictions.</p>
		<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this disclosure, the term “work vehicle” refers to a vehicle used to perform a task at a work site. A “work site” includes any place where work is carried out, such as a field, forest, or construction site. A “field” refers to any place where agricultural work is performed, such as an orchard, farm, paddy field, grain farm, or pasture. A work vehicle may include an agricultural machine such as a tractor, rice planter, combine harvester, riding field management vehicle, or riding mower, as well as a non-agricultural vehicle such as a construction work vehicle or snowplow. The work vehicles described in this disclosure may be equipped with an implement (also called a “work machine” or “work device”) attached to at least one of its front and rear portions, depending on the nature of the work. Travel of a work vehicle while performing a task may be referred to as “tasked travel.”</p>
		<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An “agricultural machine” refers to a machine for agricultural application. Examples of agricultural machines include tractors, harvesters, rice planters, riding field management vehicles, vegetable transplanters, mowers, seeders, spreaders, and agricultural mobile robots. Not only may a work vehicle such as a tractor function as an “agricultural machine” on its own, but also the entire combination of a work vehicle and an implement attached to or towed by the work vehicle may function as an “agricultural machine.” An agricultural machine performs agricultural work on the ground in a field, such as tilling, seeding, pest control, fertilizing, planting crops, or harvesting.</p>
		<p id="p-0024" num="0023">“Self-driving” refers to controlling the movement of agricultural machine through the function of a controller without manual operation by an operator. An agricultural machine performing self-driving may be referred to as an “self-driving agricultural machine” or a “robotic agricultural machine”. During self-driving, not only the movement of the agricultural machinery but also agricultural work operations (e.g., implement operations) may be automatically controlled. When the agricultural machine is a vehicle-type machine, traveling of the agricultural machine by self-driving is referred to as “self-traveling”. The controller may be configured or programmed to control at least one of steering, travel speed adjustment, and start and stop of movement necessary for the movement of the agricultural machine. When controlling a work vehicle with an implement attached, the controller may also be configured or programmed to control operations such as raising and lowering the implement, and starting and stopping the operation of the implement. Movement by self-driving may include not only movement of the agricultural machine along a predetermined path toward a destination, but also movement following a tracking target. Agricultural machine performing self-driving may partially move based on user instructions. Additionally, the agricultural machine performing self-driving may operate in a manual operation mode in which it moves by manual operation of the operator, in addition to the self-driving mode. Steering the agricultural machine through the function of the controller without manual operation is referred to as “automatic steering”. A portion or entirety of the controller may be external to the agricultural machine. Communication of control signals, commands, or data may occur between the controller external to the agricultural machine and the agricultural machine. An agricultural machine performing self-driving may move autonomously while sensing the surrounding environment without human involvement in controlling the movement of the agricultural machine. The agricultural machine capable of autonomous movement can travel unmanned within the field or outside the field (e.g., on roads). During autonomous movement, obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance maneuvers may be performed.</p>
		<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An “environment map” is data that expresses the position or area of objects existing in the environment where the agricultural machine moves, using a predetermined coordinate system. The environment map may be simply referred to as a “map” or “map data”. The coordinate system defining the environment map may be, for example, a world coordinate system such as a geographic coordinate system fixed to the Earth. The environment map may include information other than position (e.g., attribute information and other information) about objects existing in the environment. The environment map includes various types of maps such as point cloud maps or grid maps. Local maps or partial maps generated or processed in the process of constructing the environment map are also referred to as “maps” or “map data”.</p>

				<b>1</b>
			</figref>, the work vehicle 
			<b>100</b> includes a fuel cell module (FC module) 
			<b>10</b> and a motor 
			<b>70</b>, which are directly or indirectly supported by the front frame 
			<b>102</b>A. The FC module 
			<b>10</b> includes a fuel cell stack (FC stack) and functions as an onboard power generator that generates electricity from fuel, as will be described later. Hereinafter, the terms “FC module” or “FC stack” may simply be referred to as “fuel cell.”
		</p>
		<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The motor 
			<b>70</b> is electrically connected to the FC module 
			<b>10</b>. The motor 
			<b>70</b> converts the electric power generated by the FC module 
			<b>10</b> into mechanical motion (power) to produce the driving force (traction) necessary for the work vehicle 
			<b>100</b> to travel. An example of the motor 
			<b>70</b> is an AC synchronous motor. Since the FC stack of the FC module 
			<b>10</b> generates direct current, when the motor 
			<b>70</b> is an AC synchronous motor, a group of electrical circuits, including an inverter device, is installed between the FC stack and the motor 
			<b>70</b> to convert the direct current to alternating current. A portion of such electrical circuit group may be inside the FC module 
			<b>10</b>, while another portion of the electrical circuit group may be attached to the motor 
			<b>70</b> as a motor drive circuit.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The motor 
			<b>70</b> includes an output shaft 
			<b>71</b> that rotates. The torque of the output shaft 
			<b>71</b> is transmitted to the rear wheels 
			<b>104</b>R through mechanical components such as a transmission (gearbox) and a rear wheel differential gear device installed inside the transmission case 
			<b>102</b>B. In other words, the power generated by the motor 
			<b>70</b>, which serves as the power source, is transmitted to the rear wheels 
			<b>104</b>R through a power transmission system (drivetrain) 
			<b>74</b> including the transmission installed in the transmission case 
			<b>102</b>B. For this reason, the “transmission case” may also be referred to as a “mission case.” In four-wheel drive mode, a portion of the power of the motor 
			<b>70</b> is also transmitted to the front wheels 
			<b>104</b>F. The power of the motor 
			<b>70</b> may be used not only to drive the work vehicle 
			<b>100</b> but also to operate implements. Specifically, a power take-off (PTO) shaft 
			<b>76</b> is provided at the rear end of the transmission case 
			<b>102</b>B. The PTO shaft 
			<b>76</b> is driven by the motor 
			<b>70</b> and is configured to be connected to implements. The torque from the output shaft 
			<b>71</b> of the motor 
			<b>70</b> is transmitted to the PTO shaft 
			<b>76</b>. Implements attached to or towed by the work vehicle

		<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, the work vehicle

			<b>71</b> of the motor 
			<b>70</b> is mechanically coupled to the power transmission system 
			<b>74</b>, including the transmission in the transmission case 
			<b>102</b>B. The motor 
			<b>70</b> efficiently generates torque over a relatively wide range of rotational speeds compared to an internal combustion engine. However, by utilizing the power transmission system 
			<b>74</b>, including the transmission, it becomes easier to adjust the torque and rotational speed from the motor 
			<b>70</b> over an even wider range by performing multi-stage or continuously variable speed change operations. This configuration allows for efficient execution of not only the travel of the work vehicle

		<p id="p-0101" num="0097">The work vehicle may be equipped with an automatic driving function. That is, the work vehicle can travel by the action of the controller without manual operation. The work vehicle

		</p>
		<p id="p-0102" num="0098">The work vehicle

		</p>
		<p id="p-0103" num="0099">An example of self-driving control of the work vehicle is described in detail in the unpublished patent application filed by the present applicant, Japanese Patent Application No. 2022-097611.

		<p id="p-0104" num="0100">In this example embodiment, the controller changes the manner of stopping the motor

			<b>8</b> is within the field or not. Specifically, the controller makes the time from when the travel stop command is issued until the motor 
			<b>70</b> stops shorter when the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> is within the field than when the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> is outside the field.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0105" num="0101">The time from when the travel stop command is issued until the motor 
			<b>70</b> stops when the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> is outside the field is referred to as the “first stop time”. The time from when the travel stop command is issued until the motor 
			<b>70</b> stops when the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> is within the field is referred to as the “second stop time”. The second stop time is shorter than the first stop time.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0106" num="0102">In this example embodiment, the travel stop command may be issued, for example, from the FC system ECU 
			<b>5</b>, or a primary computer that communicates with the FC system ECU 
			<b>5</b>, to the main ECU 
			<b>3</b> or the ECU 
			<b>72</b>A that controls the driving of the motor 
			<b>70</b>. Alternatively, the travel stop command may be issued from the main ECU 
			<b>3</b> to the ECU 
			<b>72</b>A.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0107" num="0103">The FC meter 
			<b>6</b> is configured to display indicators that indicate the operating state of the FC power generation system 
			<b>180</b>. The display on the FC meter 
			<b>6</b> may include, for example, an indicator to notify abnormalities in the FC power generation system 
			<b>180</b>, and indicators such as a water temperature gauge to indicate the state of the radiator device (e.g., temperature measured by the temperature sensor S
			<b>3</b>).
		</p>
		<p id="p-0108" num="0104">A pressure sensor may be provided in the fuel tank 
			<b>50</b> to measure the remaining amount of fuel in the fuel tank 
			<b>50</b>. Furthermore, a temperature sensor may be provided to measure the temperature inside the fuel tank 
			<b>50</b>. For example, the FC system ECU 
			<b>5</b> acquires sensor data output from the temperature sensor of the fuel tank 
			<b>50</b> and measures the temperature of the fuel tank 
			<b>50</b> based on the sensor data. Furthermore, the FC system ECU 
			<b>5</b> acquires sensor data output from the pressure sensor of the fuel tank 
			<b>50</b> and measures the pressure (residual pressure) of the fuel in the fuel tank 
			<b>50</b> based on the sensor data.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0109" num="0105">The FC system ECU 
			<b>5</b> determines whether each of the temperature of the fuel tank

			<b>50</b> or the pressure of the fuel is not within the normal range, the FC system ECU 
			<b>5</b> may, for example, turn on or flash an indicator notifying an abnormality in the FC power generation system 
			<b>180</b>. For example, a stop button for emergency stopping of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> during automatic travel may be displayed on the screen of the operation terminal 
			<b>400</b>. When a driver seated in the driver seat 
			<b>107</b> who notices the lighting or flashing of the indicator presses this stop button or a switch provided in the cabin 
			<b>105</b>, the main ECU 
			<b>3</b>, for example, issues a travel stop command to the ECU 
			<b>72</b>A in response to this press. The ECU 
			<b>72</b>A stops the motor 
			<b>70</b> in response to the travel stop command.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0110" num="0106">In another example, when a user performing remote operation using a terminal device presses a stop button displayed on the terminal device, the main ECU 
			<b>3</b>, for example, may issue a travel stop command to the ECU 
			<b>72</b>A in response to this press. Alternatively, when the FC system ECU 
			<b>5</b> detects an abnormality in the FC power generation system 
			<b>180</b>, it may issue a travel stop command to, for example, the ECU 
			<b>72</b>A. The ECU 
			<b>72</b>A stops the motor 
			<b>70</b> in response to the travel stop command. In this manner, in this example embodiment, during the driving of the motor 
			<b>70</b>, a travel stop command is issued mainly for emergency stopping when an abnormality in the FC power generation system 
			<b>180</b> is detected. However, the issuance of the travel stop command is not limited to when an abnormality occurs in the FC power generation system. A travel stop command may be issued when the stop button is pressed. Alternatively, for example, a travel stop command may be issued to stop the work vehicle in place when an obstacle is detected by the positioning system during self-traveling in the field.

		</p>
		<p id="p-0113" num="0109">The controller is configured or programmed to execute automatic travel control based on sensor data output from the positioning system 
			<b>8</b>, in cooperation with the positioning system 
			<b>8</b> (step S
			<b>110</b>).
		</p>
		<p id="p-0114" num="0110">Suppose that a driver or user notices, for example, an abnormality in the FC power generation system 
			<b>180</b> and presses a stop button displayed on the screen of the operation terminal 
			<b>400</b> or terminal device. In that case, a travel stop command is issued in response to this press (step S
			<b>120</b>), and the processing performed by the controller proceeds to the next step S
			<b>130</b>. The controller continues the automatic travel control until the travel stop command is issued (No in step S
			<b>120</b>, step S
			<b>110</b>).
		</p>
		<p id="p-0115" num="0111">In response to the travel stop command issued during the driving of the motor 
			<b>70</b>, the controller determines whether the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> identified by the positioning system 
			<b>8</b> is within the field or outside the field (step S
			<b>130</b>). The storage 
			<b>7</b> described above may further store an environmental map of an area including one or more fields. In this example embodiment, for example, in an environment where the reception status of satellite signals transmitted from GNSS satellites is good or relatively good, the GNSS receiver 
			<b>8</b>A of the positioning system 
			<b>8</b> performs positioning, and in an environment where the reception status is not good, the self-position estimator 
			<b>8</b>C performs self-position estimation to identify or estimate the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b>.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0116" num="0112">The controller determines whether the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> is within the field or outside the field based on the position identified by the positioning system 
			<b>8</b> and the environmental map stored in the storage 
			<b>7</b>. For example, the controller acquires position data indicating the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> generated by the GNSS receiver 
			<b>8</b>A. The position data includes information on the geographical coordinates of the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b>. The information on geographical coordinates includes, for example, information on latitude and longitude.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0117" num="0113">The environmental map stored in the storage 
			<b>7</b> includes information on the geographical coordinates of the area shown by the map. For example, the environmental map may include a plurality of area polygons corresponding to a plurality of areas, and further include attribute data indicating the attributes of objects located within each area. Each of the plurality of area polygons is defined by geographical coordinates.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0118" num="0114">The controller determines the area corresponding to the geographical coordinates indicated by the position data of the identified work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> using the environmental map. The determined area corresponds to the area where the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> is located. In this manner, the controller is configured or programmed to determine whether the area corresponding to the geographical coordinates indicated by the position data is within the field or outside the field.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0119" num="0115">When the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> is within the field (Yes in step S
			<b>130</b>), the controller stops the motor 
			<b>70</b> after the second stop time from the travel stop command. For example, the controller stops the motor 
			<b>70</b> by turning off the first switch R
			<b>1</b> (step S
			<b>140</b>). When the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> is within the field, the controller may stop the motor 
			<b>70</b> by turning off both the first switch R
			<b>1</b> and the second switch R
			<b>2</b> in response to the travel stop command. On the other hand, when the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> is outside the field (No in step S
			<b>130</b>), the controller stops the motor 
			<b>70</b> after the first stop time from the travel stop command (step S
			<b>150</b>). In other words, after receiving the travel stop command, the controller maintains the driving of the motor for a certain time (e.g., the first stop time) before stopping the motor 
			<b>70</b>. After receiving the travel stop command, power supply to the motor 
			<b>70</b> may be maintained for a predetermined time.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0120" num="0116">When the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> is outside the field, the controller may perform the following operations instead of turning off each switch. For example, the ECU 
			<b>72</b>A stops the control of the inverter device 
			<b>72</b> after the first stop time elapses after receiving the travel stop command. Alternatively, after receiving the travel stop command, the FC system ECU 
			<b>5</b> may instruct the controller 
			<b>42</b> of the FC module 
			<b>10</b> to stop power generation after the first stop time elapses, thus stopping the power generation of the FC module 
			<b>10</b>.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0121" num="0117">In this manner, when a travel stop command is issued while performing automatic travel control, the controller stops the motor 
			<b>70</b> at different timings depending on whether the position of the work vehicle 
			<b>200</b> is within the field or not.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0122" num="0118">According to the stopping control of the work vehicle in this example embodiment, for a work vehicle traveling or working in the field, the controller immediately shuts off power supply to the motor by turning off the first switch in response to, for example, an emergency stop command, thereby stopping the motor. Therefore, the work vehicle traveling or working in the field can be immediately stopped in emergency. Furthermore, by turning off both the first switch and the second switch in response to, for example, an emergency stop command, the controller completely shuts off power supply to the motor immediately, enabling appropriate stopping of the motor.</p>
		<p id="p-0123" num="0119">For a work vehicle traveling outside the field, the controller maintains the driving of the motor for the first stop time after receiving the travel stop command, allowing the work vehicle to continue traveling. In other words, the controller does not immediately shut off power supply to the motor in response to the travel stop command. This allows, for example, for moving the work vehicle to the shoulder of the road. After moving the work vehicle to the shoulder of the road, the controller may stop the motor by turning off the first switch and/or the second switch. In this manner, the work vehicle can be safely parked in a safe place.</p>
		<p id="p-0124" num="0120">The work vehicle in this example embodiment is not limited to self-driving. In other words, even when the work vehicle is being manually driven, the controller can stop the motor at different timings depending on whether the position of the work vehicle is within the field or not when a travel stop command is issued during the driving of the motor, that is, during the travel of the work vehicle.</p>
		<p id="p-0125" num="0121">The configurations and operations of the above example embodiments are exemplary, and the present disclosure is not limited to the above example embodiments.

		<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
		<p id="p-0039" num="0076">The present disclosure generally relates to a control system for a mobile work machine that control machine operation using work quality metrics obtained based on image analysis of a worksite. As noted above, work machines can take a wide variety of different forms, such as, but not limited to, construction machines, turf management machines, forestry machines, agricultural machines, etc. Some examples of agricultural machines include, but are not limited to, a tilling machine, a planting machine, a product application (e.g., spraying) machine, a harvesting machine (also referred to as a “harvester” or “combine”), to name a few. While examples below are discussed in the context of an agricultural machine, but it should be understood that the features and concepts can be applied to other forms of work machines as well.</p>
		<p id="p-0040" num="0077">Some work machines can operate in autonomous or semi-autonomous modes in which aspects of the machine operation are controlled without requiring direct operator (or other user) input. The quality of work operations (referred to as “work quality”) can be affected by various factors. For instance, machine speed can affect productivity and efficiency. To illustrate, during a pass over a field by an agricultural combine, the header can be lowered too late or raised to early, resulting in unharvested areas (e.g., a coverage gap) of the field. A coverage gap can occur even if in situations where control is automated, e.g. based on worksite maps (e.g., crop maps) or imagery. For example, aerial imagery of a field can be obtained and used to identify areas of the crop to be harvested. The image processing can identify the boundaries of the crop, such as field boundaries, waterways or other non-crop areas, etc. The control system can then control the combine to raise and lower the header at the edges of these identified crop areas. Even in such cases, it can be that delays or other inaccuracies in actuation of the machine subsystems result in coverage gaps where unharvested crop remains due to the header being raised or lowered too early or late. Similar issues with coverage gaps can arise with other types of agricultural machines, such as tillers, seeders, sprayers, etc.</p>
		<p id="p-0041" num="0078">The present disclosure provides a control system for a work machine, such as but not limited to an autonomous or semi-autonomous agricultural machine, that performs machine control using image-based work quality. The work quality analysis can be utilized to adjust operation of the machine, such as in a subsequent (e.g., adjacent or other) pass over the field. For instance, settings and parameters of the machine can be adjusted to account for coverage gaps represented by the image-based work quality obtained during the previous pass. In the above combine example, assume that image data obtained during a first pass over the field indicates that the header was lifted early resulting in three feet of unharvested crop in the first pass. Using the performance data, the control system can adjust the machine settings in a second pass, which can be immediately adjacent to the first pass or another pass in the field. Illustratively, in the second pass, the control system identifies the work control point representing the field operation boundary (e.g., the end of the crop rows, the edge of the field, etc.), as indicated by a field map, imagery, or any other data. The control system then adjusts the machine settings corresponding to that work control point based on the performance data from the first pass, i.e. by changing the header settings to keep the header lowered three feet beyond the work control point to avoid a coverage gap in the second pass.</p>
		<p id="p-0042" num="0079">It is noted that examples discussed herein refer to passes as “first”, “second”, etc. Such use of “first”, “second”, etc. is meant to distinguish between the passes for discussion purposes, and is not intended to be limited to a particular pass, e.g. within a sequence of passes, during the worksite operation. That is, a “first” pass can refer to the initial pass of the machine on the worksite, as well any other pass over the worksite during the operation. Similarly, a “second” or “subsequent” pass is not intended to be limited to a next pass after the “first” pass.</p>

		<p id="p-0052" num="0089">Material sensors

		<p id="p-0053" num="0090">Position/route sensors

		<p id="p-0056" num="0093">Performance metric generator component 
			<b>148</b> and work quality-based machine control system 
			<b>150</b> are discussed in further detail below. Briefly, however, component 
			<b>148</b> is configured to generate performance metrics indicative of the operational performance of work machine 
			<b>102</b>. The performance metrics indicate a quality of the work being performed by machine 
			<b>102</b> on one or more dimensions. Some of the performance metrics can have an inverse relationship to machine speed. That is, the performance metric decreases (e.g., the work quality degrades) as machine speed increases. In one example, performance metric generator component 
			<b>148</b> is configured to calculate a performance or work quality score for each of a plurality of different performance pillars (or performance categories) that can be used to characterize the operation of machine 
			<b>102</b>. The performance categories can vary depending on the type of work machine and operations to be performed on the worksite. The particular performance pillars, and associated scores, are described in greater detail below.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0057" num="0094">Also, as discussed in further detail below, control system 
			<b>150</b> can measure and evaluate external job quality based on images acquired of the worksite. For example, in an agricultural machine, images are required from a first pass over a field and are utilized to generate a performance metric representing a work quality of the agricultural operation. For instance, a performance metric can indicate coverage gaps in the machine operation, such as unharvested crop, untilled field areas, unseeded field areas, etc. The performance metric from the first pass is utilized to adjust performance of the machine during subsequent operation, such as during a second pass (adjacent or non-adjacent) over the field.

		<p id="p-0060" num="0097">Settings control component 
			<b>144</b> can control one or more of subsystems 
			<b>108</b> in order to change machine settings based upon the predicted and/or observed conditions or characteristics of the worksite. By way of example, in the case of an agricultural harvesting machine or combine, settings control component 
			<b>144</b> can actuate actuators 
			<b>164</b> that change the positioning of a header, the concave clearance, etc., based upon the predicted yield or biomass to be encountered by the machine. In the case of an agricultural tilling machine, settings control component 
			<b>144</b> can control the positioning or down pressure on the tilling implement by controlling actuators 
			<b>164</b>.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0061" num="0098">In one example, control of the traversal of machine 
			<b>102</b> over the field can be automated or semi-automated, for example using an automated guidance system. For instance, route control component

		</p>
		<p id="p-0062" num="0099">Subsystem

		<p id="p-0077" num="0114">Material loss/savings metric generator component 
			<b>302</b> illustratively generates a metric indicative of material savings or loss that the machine 
			<b>102</b> is experiencing. In the case of an agricultural harvesting machine, the metric can indicate grain loss or savings generated by sensing and combining items, such as the mass flow of crop through the harvester sensed by a mass flow sensor, tailings volume of tailings of output by the harvester using a volume sensor, crop type, the measured loss on the harvester using various loss sensors (such as separator loss sensors, cleaning shoe loss sensors, etc.), among others. The metric can be generated by performing an evaluation of the loss using fuzzy logic components and an evaluation of the tailings, also using fuzzy logic components. Based upon these and/or other considerations, loss/savings metric generator component 
			<b>302</b> illustratively generates a loss/savings metric indicative of the performance of the machine, with respect to material loss/savings.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0078" num="0115">Material productivity metric generator component 
			<b>304</b> uses the sensor signal generated by sensors on the machine to sense productivity of the machine. In the case of an agricultural harvester, component 
			<b>304</b> illustratively uses the sensor signals generated by sensors on the machine to sense vehicle speed, mass flow of grain through the machine, and the machine configuration and generates an indication of crop yield and processes the crop yield to evaluate the crop yield against a productivity metric. For instance, a productivity metric plotted against a yield slope provides an output indicative of grain productivity. This is one example.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0079" num="0116">Fuel economy metric generator component 
			<b>306</b> illustratively generates a fuel economy metric, based upon the productivity of the machine versus fuel consumption rate sensed by sensors on the machine. For example, in the case of an agricultural harvester, the metric can be based upon the throughput versus fuel consumption rate, a separator efficiency metric and also, based upon sensed fuel consumption, vehicle state, vehicle speed, etc. The fuel economy metric can be based on a combination of working (e.g., harvest) fuel efficiency and a non-productive fuel efficiency. These metrics may include, respectively, the efficiency of the machine during working operations and other, non-working operations (such as when idling, etc.).
		</p>
		<p id="p-0080" num="0117">Power utilization metric generator component 
			<b>308</b> illustratively generates a power utilization metric based on sensor signals (or based on derived engine power used by the machine, that is derived from sensor signals). The sensors may generate sensor signals indicative of engine usage, engine load, engine speed, etc. The power utilization metric can indicate whether the machine could be more efficiently run at higher or lower power levels, etc.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0081" num="0118">Worksite coverage metric generator component 
			<b>310</b> is configured to generate a metric representing coverage of the worksite during the operation by machine 
			<b>102</b>. A worksite coverage metric can represent a measure of external job quality, external to the machine, and can be based on signals from various sensors, such as worksite imaging sensors 
			<b>140</b> that image a portion of the worksite already operated upon by machine 
			<b>102</b>. For example, in the case of a combine, worksite imaging sensors 
			<b>140</b> can image a portion of the field behind the combine, in a direction of travel of the combine, to view the area of the field already harvested by the combine. This image data can be provided to worksite coverage metric generator component 
			<b>310</b> to generate a performance metric indicative of the quality of the agricultural operation in terms of worksite coverage. For instance, the worksite coverage metric generated by component 
			<b>310</b> can indicate that a first pass over the field by the combine resulted in several feet of unharvested crop at the end of the first pass, when the header was raised at the field boundary when making a turn for a second, subsequent pass. This, of course, is for sake of example only.

		</p>
		<p id="p-0092" num="0129">The in situ data can include data from sensors

				<b>2</b>
			</figref>. In one example, worksite imaging sensors 
			<b>140</b> are configured to obtain images of the worksite in a path of work machine 
			<b>102</b>. The image data can be utilized to identify work control points on the worksite (e.g., worksite areas where the machine operation is to start or stop). In another example, the image data can indicate operation of various subsystems 
			<b>108</b>. For instance, in an agricultural tilling machine, imaging sensors can acquire images that indicate ground engagement (e.g., depth, etc.) of the tilling tools, build-up of soil on the tilling tools, etc. As such, in situ data collection component 
			<b>402</b> can receive images from a camera that detect whether the tilling tools have become plugged or is otherwise operating inefficiently. In an agricultural spraying machine, in situ data collection component

		</p>
		<p id="p-0093" num="0130">Also, the image data obtained from worksite imaging sensors 
			<b>140</b> can represent areas of the field on which the worksite operation has already been performed. For instance, in an agricultural harvesting machine, the image data can represent areas that have been past over by the machine, but have unharvested crop (e.g., a coverage gap) that was missed by the machine.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0094" num="0131">Application detection component 
			<b>404</b> is configured to detect various aspects of the application being performed by machine 
			<b>102</b> on the worksite. Illustratively, component 
			<b>404</b> includes a worksite detector 
			<b>420</b> configured to detect the worksite being operated upon by work machine 
			<b>102</b>. For instance, in the case of an agricultural machine, the detection can obtain a field identifier that identifies the particular field and can be used to obtain data identifying the target worksite operations, machine path, etc. Component 
			<b>404</b> can also include a machine detector 
			<b>422</b> configured to detect the machine

		</p>
		<p id="p-0096" num="0133">Metric comparison component 
			<b>406</b> is configured to compare a current metric value for a quality metric (representing a current performance characteristic of work machine 
			<b>102</b>) to a target or threshold value, which can be set in any of a number of ways. Examples of metric comparison are discussed in further detail below. Briefly, however, component 
			<b>406</b> is configured to determine whether work machine 
			<b>102</b> is operating at a target performance on one or more performance dimensions (e.g., threshold efficiency, spraying efficiency, etc.).
		</p>
		<p id="p-0097" num="0134">Operator presence detection component 
			<b>408</b> is configured to detect whether an operator is present on-board work machine 
			<b>102</b>. For instance, in the case of combine

			<b>408</b> is configured to detect whether an operator is present within operator compartment 
			<b>201</b>. Operator presence detection can be accomplished in a number of ways. For instance, operator presence detection can be based on input from cameras that view the operator compartment, seat switches that detect operator presence based on switch depression, input or lack of input received from operator input mechanisms (i.e., whether an operator is engaging controls within the operator compartment), to name a few.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0098" num="0135">The lateral error detection component 
			<b>410</b> is configured to detect lateral error, or the offset of machine 
			<b>102</b> relative to the target path. In one example, lateral error detection can be based on a comparison of a current location of the machine as detected based on sensor signals from positions sensors 
			<b>136</b> and a machine path defined in a work assignment.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0099" num="0136">Terrain roughness detection component 
			<b>412</b> is configured to detect roughness of the terrain being operated upon by work machine 
			<b>102</b>. Terrain roughness can be utilized to select a target machine speed based on a predefined or user selected ride quality or ride smoothness setting. As noted above, sensors 
			<b>141</b> can detect pitch, roll, and yaw of machine 
			<b>102</b>, as well as acceleration on multiple axes. Thus, pitch data during a sampling interval can be used to obtain pitch acceleration and roll data for the sampling interval can be used to obtain roll acceleration. A surface roughness estimator determines or estimates a surface roughness of the worksite area based on the detected motion data, pitch data, roll data, and/or other position or movement data.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0100" num="0137">Alternatively, or in addition, image data of the worksite in a forward field of view of machine

			<b>140</b>. Based on the collected image data, a visual surface roughness index can be estimated for the area of the field in front of machine 
			<b>102</b>.
		</p>
		<p id="p-0101" num="0138">The surface roughness could be measured in any of a number of ways. For instance, the data from sensors 
			<b>124</b> can utilized to generate a surface roughness metric on a predefined scale (e.g., 0 to 100). Based on machine speed, the field roughness can be correlated to an expected machine ride quality or roughness. For example, component 
			<b>412</b> can estimate the precise attitude (e.g., yaw data, roll data, or both) of machine 
			<b>102</b> as well as the current or predicted acceleration (e.g., in meters per second squared (m/s
			<sup>2</sup>) on any of a number of axes. The target terrain roughness can be set as a maximum attitude and/or acceleration of machine 
			<b>102</b> and the machine speed can be selected to maintain the actual machine attitude and acceleration below the target set point(s). Further, when ride quality is utilized as a weighting constraint in generating the target machine speed, a target machine ride roughness can be set and the machine speed can be selected to maintain the machine ride quality below the target setting. This, of course, is for sake of example only.

			<b>414</b> includes a curvature lookahead component 
			<b>428</b> configured to identify dimensions of curvature of the path ahead of machine 
			<b>102</b>, which can be utilized in machine settings control. Examples of machine settings control are discussed in further detail below. Briefly, the radius or degree of curvature of the machine path can be utilized to identify a predicted effect on the performance metrics, as the machine enters the curvature, which in turn can be utilized to identify a change to the machine settings (e.g., a target machine speed increase or decrease, combine header raise/lowering, tilling machine raise/lowering, etc.). Component 
			<b>414</b> can include other items 
			<b>429</b> as well.

			<b>108</b>) based on input from components of control system 
			<b>150</b>. Examples of setting selection are discussed in further detail below. Briefly, in one example, component 
			<b>416</b> utilizes an output from work quality metric comparison component 
			<b>406</b> that indicates a difference between a current metric value for a particular quality metric relative to a predefined or dynamically selected target value for that quality metric. Component 
			<b>416</b> determines a change in machine settings based on this comparison.

The machine learning and training components can include a variety of different types of learning mechanisms, such as a neural network that is trained based on corresponding training logic using training data. Briefly, a neural network can include a deep neural network (DNN), such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). Of course, other types of classification or learning mechanisms, such as rule-based classifiers, Bayesian network, decision trees, etc. can be utilized.

For sake of illustration, but not by limitation, if the performance metrics from a first pass indicate that the header of a combine was raised too soon resulting in two feet of missed crop at the end of the first pass, component

During the subsequent pass, a work control point representing the end of the target harvesting area is identified, and when the machine reaches the work control point in the subsequent pass, the settings adjustment causes the header to remain in a lowered state for two additional feet relative to the work control point.

In an example of a tilling machine, at least ninety-five percent of the target tillable area is to be actually tilled by the machine. If the detected performance of the machine during one pass over the field falls below the target metric value, component

Similarly, a worksite plan for a tilling machine can identify the target areas of the field to be tilled, a worksite plan for a spraying machine can identify the target areas of the field to be sprayed, a worksite plan for a planting machine can identify the target areas of the field to be planted, etc.

		<p id="p-0140" num="0177">It can thus be seen that the present features provide a control system that provides machine setting control using image-based work quality. The control system can operate based on image data that represents performance of an agricultural machine during a pass over a worksite. The image-based control system is configured to generate or otherwise identify a performance metric based on the image data and identify a set of machine parameters based on that performance metric, and then control the mobile work machine based on those machine settings during the subsequent operation, such as a subsequent pass over the worksite. This control can improve job quality in decisions for work control and improve the overall work performance and efficiency of the machine, especially in automated and semi-automated scenarios.</p>
		<p id="p-0141" num="0178">The present discussion has mentioned processors and servers. In one example, the processors and servers include computer processors with associated memory and timing circuitry, not separately shown. The processors and servers are functional parts of the systems or devices to which the processors and servers belong and are activated by, and facilitate the functionality of the other components or items in those systems.</p>
		<p id="p-0142" num="0179">Also, a number of user interface displays have been discussed. The user interface displays can take a wide variety of different forms and can have a wide variety of different user actuatable input mechanisms disposed thereon. For instance, the user actuatable input mechanisms can be text boxes, check boxes, icons, links, drop-down menus, search boxes, etc. The user actuatable input mechanisms can be actuated in a wide variety of different ways. For instance, user actuatable input mechanisms can be actuated using a point and click device (such as a track ball or mouse). The user actuatable input mechanisms can be actuated using hardware buttons, switches, a joystick or keyboard, thumb switches or thumb pads, etc. The user actuatable input mechanisms can also be actuated using a virtual keyboard or other virtual actuators. In addition, where the screen on which the user actuatable input mechanisms are displayed is a touch sensitive screen, the user actuatable input mechanisms can be actuated using touch gestures. Also, where the device that displays them has speech recognition components, the user actuatable input mechanisms can be actuated using speech commands.</p>
		<p id="p-0143" num="0180">A number of data stores have also been discussed. It will be noted the data stores can each be broken into multiple data stores. All of the data stores can be local to the systems accessing the data stores, all of the data stores can be remote, or some data stores can be local while others can be remote. All of these configurations are contemplated herein.</p>
		<p id="p-0144" num="0181">Also, the figures show a number of blocks with functionality ascribed to each block. It will be noted that fewer blocks can be used so the functionality is performed by fewer components. Also, more blocks can be used with the functionality distributed among more components.</p>
		<p id="p-0145" num="0182">It will be noted that the above discussion has described a variety of different systems, components, logic, and interactions. It will be appreciated that any or all of such systems, components, logic and interactions may be implemented by hardware items, such as processors, memory, or other processing components, including but not limited to artificial intelligence components, such as neural networks, some of which are described below, that perform the functions associated with those systems, components, logic, or interactions. In addition, any or all of the systems, components, logic and interactions may be implemented by software that is loaded into a memory and is subsequently executed by a processor or server or other computing component, as described below. Any or all of the systems, components, logic and interactions May also be implemented by different combinations of hardware, software, firmware, etc., some examples of which are described below.

In various examples, remote servers can deliver the services over a wide area network, such as the internet, using appropriate protocols. For instance, remote servers can deliver applications over a wide area network and the remote servers can be accessed through a web browser or any other computing component. Software or components shown in previous FIGS. as well as the corresponding data, can be stored on servers at a remote location. The computing resources in a remote server environment can be consolidated at a remote data center location or the computing resources can be dispersed. Remote server infrastructures can deliver services through shared data centers, even though the services appear as a single point of access for the user. Thus, the components and functions described herein can be provided from a remote server at a remote location using a remote server architecture. Alternatively, the components and functions can be provided from a conventional server, or the components and functions can be installed on client devices directly, or in other ways.
